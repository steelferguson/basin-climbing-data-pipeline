# Birthday Party Flow: Voice & Tone Comparison

## The Problem

The original flow messaging sounded like generic marketing copy - polished, emoji-heavy, and impersonal. It didn't match Basin's brand voice.

---

## Basin's Brand Voice (from Style Guide)

- **Down-to-earth** and humble
- **Inviting** - everyone feels they belong
- **Community-oriented** - connection over conversion
- Not corporate or salesy
- Like a friend, not a brand

## SMS Rewrites: ChatGPT Voice → Basin Voice

### Text #1 (2 hours after party)

| ChatGPT Voice | Basin Voice |
|---------------|-------------|
| "Hope the party was a blast! 🧗 If your kiddo caught the climbing bug, we'd love to see you back. Day passes are always available — no reservation needed!" | "Hey! Hope you had fun at the party. If your kiddo wants to come climb again, we're here - no reservation needed, just show up." |

**What changed:** Removed marketing phrases ("caught the climbing bug", "we'd love to see you back"). Sounds like a person texting, not a brand. Dropped the emoji.

---

### Text #2 (Day 2)

| ChatGPT Voice | Basin Voice |
|---------------|-------------|
| "Lots of kids discover they love climbing at birthday parties 🎂 If yours wants to come back, just swing by — we're open 7 days a week!" | "A lot of kids try climbing for the first time at a birthday party and end up loving it. If that's your kiddo, come hang out with us sometime." |

**What changed:** Less polished phrasing. "Come hang out with us" vs "swing by." Removed emoji. More conversational.

### Text #3 (Day 9)

| ChatGPT Voice | Basin Voice |
|---------------|-------------|
| "Just a heads up 👋 Family memberships include a FREE belay class so you can climb with your kid — show this text at the desk!" | "Quick tip - family memberships come with a free belay class so you can climb with your kid. Just mention this text at the front desk if you're interested." |

**What changed:** "Quick tip" vs "Just a heads up 👋". Added "if you're interested" - no pressure. Lowercase "free" (not shouting).

---

### Text #4 (Day 16)

| ChatGPT Voice | Basin Voice |
|---------------|-------------|
| "Curious if climbing teams might be a fit? You can book a low-stress tryout with our coaches on our Youth Teams page 🧗‍♂️" | "If your kid mentioned wanting to climb more, we have youth teams. No pressure tryouts - just come see if it's a fit." |

**What changed:** Leads with the kid's interest, not a question. "No pressure" instead of "low-stress" (more natural). Removed emoji.

---

### Text #5 (Day 28)

| ChatGPT Voice | Basin Voice |
|---------------|-------------|
| "If your kiddo's been asking to go climbing again, we're here whenever you're ready! Day passes available anytime 🧗" | "Has your kid asked about climbing again? We're open every day if you want to stop by." |

**What changed:** Simple question instead of statement. "Stop by" is more casual. No emoji, no exclamation point.

---

### Text #6 (Day 58 - Final)

| ChatGPT Voice | Basin Voice |
|---------------|-------------|
| "Thanks for coming to the party! Whenever you're ready to climb again, we're here 🧗💙" | "Thanks for coming to the party. If climbing ever comes up again, you know where to find us." |

**What changed:** Period instead of exclamation. "You know where to find us" - confident but not pushy. No emojis.

## Email Subject Line Rewrites

| # | ChatGPT Voice | Basin Voice |
|---|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | Your kiddo had fun on the wall | Good to meet you at the party |
| 2 | Why climbing clicks for so many kids | Why kids get hooked on climbing |
| 3 | Come climb together as a family | Climbing is better together |
| 4 | A weekly break for you, a confidence boost for them | Something for both of you |
| 5 | Not every kid fits traditional sports — and that's okay | Not a team sports kid? That might be a good thing. |
| 6 | How climbing teams work (and where your kid fits) | How our youth teams work |
| 7 | One membership, unlimited growth | What a membership actually gets you |
| 8 | What parents tell us after joining | What other parents have said |
| 9 | Is your kid ready for more? | Ready to take it further? |
| 10 | Come back and climb with us | The door is always open |

## Key Differences

| Aspect | ChatGPT Voice | Basin Voice |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Emojis** | 🧗🎂👋💙 everywhere | None or minimal |
| **Punctuation** | Exclamation points! | Periods. |
| **Phrasing** | "We'd love to see you back" | "We're here" |
| **Tone** | Enthusiastic, salesy | Calm, genuine |
| **Pressure** | "Day passes available anytime!" | "If you want to stop by" |
| **Closing** | "Whenever you're ready, we're here 💙" | "You know where to find us" |

## The Basin Test

Before sending any message, ask:
> "Would someone at the front desk actually say this?"

If it sounds like a marketing email, rewrite it.

## Flow IDs

- **Attendees v2 (Basin voice):** `USdXdD`
- **Attendees v1 (ChatGPT voice):** `UxDGqN` - turn this off
- **Hosts v3:** `UqwbZy` - should also be rewritten to match

---

## Next Steps

1. Turn on Attendees v2 (`USdXdD`)
2. Turn off Attendees v1 (`UxDGqN`)
3. Rewrite Host flow to match Basin voice (currently still ChatGPT-sounding)

---

## TODO: Host Flow Rewrite

The host flow (`UqwbZy`) still uses ChatGPT voice. Here are the SMS messages that need rewriting:

| # | Current (ChatGPT) | Should Be (Basin) |
|---|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | "Thanks so much for celebrating your kiddo's birthday at Basin today! They absolutely crushed it 🧗 Use code BDAY to waive all membership activation fees!" | "Hey! Thanks for having the party with us. If you want to keep climbing as a family, code BDAY waives the activation fee." |
| 2 | "Birthday families can use code BDAY to waive the $75 activation fee on any climbing membership 🎂 Come climb together as a family!" | "Just a reminder - BDAY waives the $75 activation fee if you're thinking about a membership." |
| 3 | "Parents love this perk 👀 Family memberships include a FREE belay class so you can safely climb with your kid — just show this text at the desk!" | "Quick tip - family memberships come with a free belay class. Just mention this text at the desk." |
| 4 | "Curious if climbing teams are a fit? You can book a low-stress private tryout with our head coaches on our Youth Teams page 🧗‍♂️" | "If your kid mentioned wanting to climb more, we have youth teams. No pressure tryouts if you want to check it out." |
| 5 | "Last reminder 🎂 Code BDAY waives the $75 activation fee — perfect time to lock in climbing for your kiddo!" | "Heads up - BDAY code expires soon if you're still thinking about a membership." |
| 6 | "Thanks again for celebrating with us 🎉 Whenever your kiddo's ready to climb again, our doors are always open 🧗💙" | "Thanks again for the party. You know where to find us." |

**Email subjects also need similar treatment** - remove the marketing polish, make them sound human.
